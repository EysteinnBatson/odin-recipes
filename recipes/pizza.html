    <p>Ever wondered where the word "pizza" comes from? Well today you get your answer.
        The word comes from the polish saying "Pie tza" which means "Great fun". So when
        the Italian prime minister visited Poland in August 1945, the Polish couldn't help themselves
        but to introduce him to this great saying.
